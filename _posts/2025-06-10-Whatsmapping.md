title: What's Mapping?
---

In the context of digital humanities, mapping refers to the process of using digital tools to visualize, analyze, and interpret spatial or conceptual data related to human culture, history, or society. This can involve:

Geospatial Mapping – Linking cultural, historical, or literary data to physical locations using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) or web-based maps (e.g., mapping historical events, migration patterns, or archaeological sites).

Conceptual Mapping – Visualizing relationships between ideas, people, texts, or artifacts using network diagrams, timelines, or topic maps.

Mapping in digital humanities allows researchers to uncover patterns, connections, and insights that may not be visible through traditional methods, making it a powerful approach for both scholarly analysis and public engagement.

## The research

- Prior to start with the actual mapping, there are a few steps to consider.

- Define Purpose & Scope – Clarify the goal, audience, and level of detail needed.

- Background Research – Review existing maps, reports, and legal or historical data.

- Stakeholder Analysis – Identify and consult key individuals or groups involved.

- Select Mapping Area – Determine the boundaries and assess access or risks.

- Assess Data Needs – Identify what data to collect and in what format.

- Choose Tools & Methods – Select software, equipment, and data collection techniques.

- Prepare Logistically – Get permissions, check equipment, and assign team roles.

- Consider Ethics & Sensitivity – Ensure respectful and responsible handling of cultural or personal data.

## Centre-Ville and May 30th, 1969 mapping

To create both mappings the researchers used similar methods, however the presentention of both are very different. The goal for both mappings is to create a visual recreation of adresse, housing and buildings on the exact adress they used to be. One with the goal of preserving the information and the other for spacial recognition.

### Approach

Both researchers consulted archives, documentation, phone books and oral history to be able to determin the exact location of the address for their maps. Cebtre-Ville is presented in a pdf-google file. While the May 30th, 69 mapping is made in Arc-Gis. 

Both creating a strong visual representation of a once upon a time era.
