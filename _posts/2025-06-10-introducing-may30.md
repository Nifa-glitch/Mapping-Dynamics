### May 30th, 1969

The May 30th, 1969 uprising, known locally as Trinta di Mei, was a major labor and social revolt in Curaçao. Sparked by a strike at the Shell oil refinery over poor working conditions and racial inequalities, the protest quickly escalated into widespread unrest in Willemstad. Demonstrators clashed with police, and parts of the city were looted and set on fire. The Dutch military was eventually deployed to restore order. The uprising marked a turning point in the island's history, leading to significant political, social, and cultural changes, including greater empowerment of Afro-Curaçaoans and reforms in labor rights and governance.

### Arc Gis

ArcGIS is a powerful geographic information system (GIS) software developed by Esri that allows users to create, analyze, manage, and share spatial data and maps. It is widely used in research, urban planning, environmental studies, and digital humanities to visualize geographic relationships and patterns. Through tools like StoryMap and Web Experience Builder, users can integrate images, audio, video, and interactive data to create rich, multimedia narratives and engaging, user-friendly presentations of spatial information.
