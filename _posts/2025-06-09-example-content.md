Centre-Ville is a community-oriented initiative aimed at promoting the heritage and supporting the sustainable development of historical Caribbean city/town centers, through cooperative research and information sharing. The Heritage Addresses Survey is a research project seeks to identify and digitally document the existing heritage addresses of buildings or lots along selected streets, roads and lanes within a city/town center. In addition, to create interactive, easy-to-share “historical snapshots” listing the business-related or civic entities which currently occupy those address locations.
