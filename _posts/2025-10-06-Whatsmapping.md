title: What's Mapping?
---

In the context of digital humanities, mapping refers to the process of using digital tools to visualize, analyze, and interpret spatial or conceptual data related to human culture, history, or society. This can involve:

Geospatial Mapping – Linking cultural, historical, or literary data to physical locations using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) or web-based maps (e.g., mapping historical events, migration patterns, or archaeological sites).

Conceptual Mapping – Visualizing relationships between ideas, people, texts, or artifacts using network diagrams, timelines, or topic maps.

Mapping in digital humanities allows researchers to uncover patterns, connections, and insights that may not be visible through traditional methods, making it a powerful approach for both scholarly analysis and public engagement.
